            My Baby,  
            <br><br>
            Words cannot express how much you mean to me. Every moment with you feels like a dream come true. Your smile lights up my world, your laughter warms my heart, and your love gives my life meaning in ways I never thought possible.  
            <br><br>
            I am always grateful for every moments and memories we've created together and for the countless ones yet to come. You are my everything, and I vow to cherish you with all that I am, now and forever.  
            <br><br>
            With all my love,  
            <br>
            Your Nathaniel ❤️
